# Implementation of the popular paper "Attention is all you Need"

This repository contains an implementation of the seminal paper ["Attention is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al., which introduced the Transformer model. The Transformer architecture revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) and serves as the foundation for models like BERT, GPT, and T5.

## Features
- Implementation of the Transformer model from scratch.
- Includes Multi-Head Self-Attention, Position-wise Feedforward, and Positional Encoding.
- Supports training and evaluation on standard NLP datasets.
- Optimized with PyTorch (or TensorFlow, specify if needed).
- Easy-to-follow and modular code structure.
